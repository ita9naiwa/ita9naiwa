Recently I'm learning stuffs with chatGPT. I found that it is exteremly useful to use chatGPT to learn something new.


Some Pros:

- I can dive into codebase first with few prior knowledge. chatgpt isn't pretty good at generating code yet but good at explaining concepts like "Vector" in mlir.
- Enable semantic search, not keyword matching query. For example, I can query like "what is that doing ..." this kind of query will yield bad answers with google search, mostly.
